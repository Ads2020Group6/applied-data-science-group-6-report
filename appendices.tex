\section{TPOT configuration}
\label{tpot-config}

We ran TPOT with the parameters 
\code{generations=10},
\code{population\_size=150}, 
\code{cv=3} (3-fold cross-validation as in our manual model)
search,
\code{scoring='r2'} (optimising for the $R^2$ score).

The search lasted more than 5 hours, and produced models which were only slightly more accurate than the hand-tuned models.

As an example output, for the Median pay gap the best model was:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
make_pipeline(
    StackingEstimator(estimator=AdaBoostRegressor(learning_rate=0.5,
        loss="linear", n_estimators=100)),
    ExtraTreesRegressor(bootstrap=False, max_features=0.8, 
        min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=7, 
        n_estimators=100)
)
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

Unfortunately, stacked pipelines do not work with the explainability tools we used, so we did not pursue AutoML further.

% and found the best model for the mean to be an \code{ExtraTreesRegressor} (\cite{extra-tree-regressor}) with parameters \code{bootstrap=False},
% \code{max\_features=0.7500000000000001},
% \code{min\_samples\_leaf=1},
% \code{min\_samples\_split=2},
% \code{n\_estimators=100}.
